hi,

do u know how to read the memory contents.
e.g.  pokeb, pokew in basic.

i dont know the corresponding function in
vb6.0 so if u know, please let me know.

i have a program that would read the desktop
without using image controls so it would be
faster to transfer over the net.

and an antivirus program which i am porting
from DOS.  

i would be posting these when finished.

thanks for your help...
